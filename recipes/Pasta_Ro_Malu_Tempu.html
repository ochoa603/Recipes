    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This peasant dish from Sicily translates to “pasta when the weather is bad”. <br>
       It is what fishermen made when the weather conditions didn't allow them to fish. <br>
        Besides broccoli and pasta, it uses common ingredients found in every Sicilian <br> 
         kitchen such as pine nuts, raisins, bread crumbs, anchovies, and saffron..</p>

   
      <h3>Ingrdients</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>2 tablespoons raisins</li>
           <li>1 (12 ounce) package rigatoni pasta</li>
           <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
           <li>4 anchovies anchovy fillets</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
           <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
           <li>1 head broccoli, separated into florets</li>
           <li>4 threads saffron threads</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
           <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
           <li>¼ cup toasted bread crumbs</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons toasted bread crumbs</li>
           <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
       </ul>

      <h3>Directions</h3>  
       <ol>
                <li>Soak raisins in warm water for 10 minutes; drain and set aside.</li>
            <br>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>
                 Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally <br>
                 until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes..</li>
            <br>
            
                <li>At the same time, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. <br>
                    Lightly saute anchovies, onions, and garlic, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. <br>
                    Mash the anchovies a bit to help them dissolve to create a paste. <br>
                    Add broccoli and begin to saute over medium heat, stirring often to avoid burning. <br>
                    Cook evenly until softened, about 10 minutes. Break up large florets as soon as they softens; <br>
                    ideally, you want bite-sized florets. Add ladles of the pasta water to the skillet as needed to keep the broccoli from burning.</li>

                <li>Add a ladle of pasta water to a small bowl, add the saffron threads, <br>
                    and allow to melt. Add to the broccoli. Mash some of the smaller florets to <br>
                    help create a creamy sauce. Add the pine nuts, raisins, and cinnamon. Stir often.</li>

             
                    <li>Drain cooked pasta, reserving the pasta water. Stir pasta into the skillet. <br>
                         Sprinkle in 1/4 cup bread crumbs and red pepper flakes. Toss to coat, <br>
                          adding a few tablespoons of pasta water if necessary. Drizzle remaining oil <br>
                           and 2 tablespoons bread crumbs over the top and add black pepper. Serve hot.</li>
       </ol>
