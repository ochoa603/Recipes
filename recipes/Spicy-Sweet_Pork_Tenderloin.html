    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A pork tenderloin is a long, narrow, boneless cut of meat <br> 
        that comes from the muscle that runs along the backbone. <br>
        A pork loin is wider and flatter, and can be a boneless or bone-in cut of meat. <br>
         Pork loin comes from the back of the animal.</p>

    <p>Pork tenderloin is one of the leanest, most tender cuts of meat on the market, <br>
       so it can also be a little spendy. Pork loin, on the other hand, <br>
       can often be a bargain choice if you're looking for  <br>
       a tender cut of meat that cooks well for a crowd. Here's what you need to know <br>
       before you cook either meat, and how to tell the difference between pork tenderloin and pork loin.</p>
      <h3>Ingrdients</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
           <li>1 pound pork tenderloin, cut into 3/4-inch slices</li>
           <li>â…“ cup salsa</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon seedless raspberry preserves</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Directions</h3>  
       <ol>
            <li>Mix soy sauce, ginger, and garlic in a small bowl.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. <br>
                Arrange pork slices in a single layer in the skillet. <br>
                Spoon soy sauce mixture over the pork. Cook pork until completely browned <br>
                and just slightly pink in the center, about 3 minutes per side. <br>
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees <br>

                  Spoon sauce over pork slices and top with cilantro.</li>
       </ol>
